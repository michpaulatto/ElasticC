# ElasticC
Elastic properties calculator using effective medium theory for composite materials.
Main capabilities:
1. Calculate common general limits:
- Voigt and Reuss bounds
- hashin-Shtrikman bounds
2. Implementation of self-consistent approximation for multi-phase composites as descibed by Berryman (1980)
3. Implementation of differential effective medium theory
