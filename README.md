# ElasticC

Elastic properties calculator using effective medium theory for composite materials.
This is a collection of routines developed and modified over several years to estimate the elstic properties of multi-phase materials. I am currently restructuring the library to make it more useful for others. I welcome suggestion, corrections and additions. 

# Main capabilities:
1. Calculate common general limits:
- Voigt and Reuss bounds
- Hashin-Shtrikman bounds
2. Implementation of self-consistent approximation for multi-phase composites as descibed by Berryman (1980)
3. Implementation of differential effective medium theory
